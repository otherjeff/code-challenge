# TechStars Engineering: Fun with Code

## Neat Features

1. Tags are downcased and sorted

1. The web app is fully responsive (thanks, Bootstrap)

## TODO

Here are a few things I deferred due to time constraints/because this is a
prototype...

1. Add error messages for invalid Founder submissions. Presence and uniqueness
are validated server-side, but no client error is shown.

1. The button for deleting Founders is annoying because only a ' ' character
inside is a link. Fix this either with some Javascript or by wrapping the link
around the Glyphicon (the link is generated by Rails).

1. Once you delete a Founder, you cannot recreate one with the same name because
of the uniqueness check. It might be that ActiveRecord is flipping a bit to
delete rather than running a `DELETE` query, or it might be something else.

1. Tags are not stored optimally. They should be created with a many-to-many
relationship, most likely with an intermediate DB table associating a
`company_id` to a `tag_id`. Due to time constraints, I just made a one-to-many
association between a Company and its Tags.
